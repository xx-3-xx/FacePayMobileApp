Why It's Critical
-----------------
FacePay solves a pressing need for **secure, touchless, and frictionless payments** by enabling **on-device facial recognition** that is private by design. Built specifically for **MSMEs**, it brings enterprise-grade biometric payment technology to small businesses at an accessible price point.


- üßæ **Merchant Web Portal** ‚Äì For MSMEs to onboard, manage business profiles, and accept payments
- üì± **Mobile App** ‚Äì For consumers to authenticate identity and make payments using face recognition

## üíº Business Model

Our monetization is based on a **tiered subscription model** tailored to MSME needs:

| Plan    | Monthly Fee | Free Transaction Volume | Excess Fee |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Starter | RM39        | RM10,000                 | 2.0%       |
| Growth  | RM99        | RM30,000                 | 2.0%       |
| Pro     | RM299       | RM100,000                | 2.0%       |

> üí≥ Beyond the free transaction volume, a flat 2.0% fee is applied.

Get Started for FacePay Mobile App
-----------

## üß™ Local Development Setup

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Git
- Chrome or Edge browser (for webcam & push API testing)
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local HTTPS (optional but recommended)

Clone and enter the mobile app repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/FacePayMobileApp.git
cd FacePayMobileApp


## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Face authentication must be tied to verified user accounts via eKYC (MyKad, passport, etc.).
- Only authorized merchants/devices can initiate face scan requests.
- Secure device registration to prevent rogue POS terminals.

### Biometric Security

- Use anti-spoofing (liveness detection) techniques to prevent replay or photo attacks.
- Facial embeddings are generated on-device and verified securely.
- Check more than 100+ facial points to verify user.
- No raw facial images are stored post-verification.

### Data Integrity

- Face match and transaction logs are signed and timestamped to ensure auditability.
- Device-to-server communication uses HTTPS with mutual TLS (mTLS) for integrity.

### Privacy

- Facial data is hashed and stored securely using encryption-at-rest (AES-256).
- Personally identifiable information (PII) is minimized and stored in vault services
- Only authorized services can access facial embeddings through scoped tokens.

### Payment Authorization

- Face match alone is not sufficient; Biometric reconfirmation is required for large transactions.
- Users are notified in real-time for each face-based payment.

### Device Security

- Edge devices (camera-enabled POS systems) are locked down with kiosk mode and remote kill switch.
- Software updates are signed and enforced via OTA firmware controls.
- Device tamper detection and logging are in place.

### Compliance

- Follows PDPA (Malaysia), GDPR (EU), and other relevant biometric privacy laws.
- User consent is mandatory before enrollment and each biometric transaction.
- Regular external security audits and penetration testing are conducted.
